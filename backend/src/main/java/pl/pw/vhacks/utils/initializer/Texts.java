For some women, it is a part of cultural heritage of their motherland. For some other, it is a duty they pay to their religion, or a symbol of their faith. It can be also just a matter of fashion. Unfortunately, sometimes women do not choose what they wear.";

Different Christian churches have a bit different way of baptising, but in common, putting the water is a symbol of cleaning the children from the original sin of Adam, the first man. It is a sign that a child becomes a member of the church. It may be a bit scary and cold for the baby, but they do care to make it safely and quickly, so the baby does not suffer much.";

So if your friends are Muslims, they go to a mosque, if they are Jews then they attend sinagogue, if Buddhist - a Buddhist temple. All these buildings are places where people meet with each other and with the God to praise him. They simply do it in different ways. There are also some people who do not believe that the God exists - and so they do not go to any church or temple.";

    public static String answer4 = "People have different diets because of their own beliefs and health issues. Some people simply do not want to eat animal food because they do not want to hurt them. Other people may have religious restrictions on food. For example, Muslims cannot eat pork and Hindu cannot eat beef. In Islam, the religion of Muslims, pork is regarded as impure and unhealthy food because pigs spend their live rolling in the mud. On the other hand, Hindu do not eat cows meet because of respect. They believe that cows are special animals, as they do provide the people with milk, which is the basis of many meals. So, there can be many reasons for which your friend does not want to eat burger. You can ask him directly about his diet, and you can then share with him the food he can eat according to his own faith.";

In different parts of the world, people found different ways of prayer and meditation. Some, as Christians, kneel on their knees. Some other pray while sitting cross-legged. And finally some, like Muslims, prefer repeated body motions.";

However, no person will have to prepare the food as here on earth, and we will not have to buy the food. In heaven, we will not lack anything, so no worries - you will be really happy.";
